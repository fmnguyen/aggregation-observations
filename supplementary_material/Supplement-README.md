# Exploring the Effects of Aggregation Choices

This repository contains all materials for the project "Exploring the Effects of Aggregation Choices on Untrained Visualization Usersâ€™ Generalizations from Data".

[E1]Main_Results.Rmd and [E2]Main_Results.Rmd contain all analyses used in the submission.

You can use these R markdown documents and the anonymized data files provided in our repository to reproduce the analyses we present in the paper.

These markdown files walk through the thought process behind our analyses and provide many additional figures in order to help provide additional context for interpreting the findings we present in the paper.

If you lack an interpreter for R markdown, find also supplied pre-knit html documents. [E1]Main_Results.html and [E2]Main_Results.html are web-documents that compile the R Markdown for view in a web browser.
